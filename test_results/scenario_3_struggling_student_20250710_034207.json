Let me try to remember what my teacher said.\n\nI think there are different ways to solve these... like factoring? And there's also a formula but I don't remember it exactly.\n\nLet me see if I can factor this. I need to find two numbers that... um... I think they need to multiply to something and add to something else? I'm not sure exactly how this works.\n\nMaybe I should try the quadratic formula instead? I remember it has a square root in it and fractions. Something like x equals negative b plus or minus square root of... something... over 2a?\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI know that when we solve equations, we want to get x by itself. So maybe I can move things around? But with the x\u00b2 term it's more complicated.\n\nI think I need to identify the parts of the equation first. The x\u00b2 part, the x part, and the number part. Then I can use one of the methods we learned.\n\nI'm really struggling with this. I know I need to find the values of x that make the equation true, but I'm not sure about the exact steps. Could you help me understand which method would be best to use here?\n\nI want to learn this properly, not just get the answer.\n",
