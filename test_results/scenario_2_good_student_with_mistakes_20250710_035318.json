I think a is the coefficient of x\u00b2, b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant term.\n\nWait, actually let me try factoring first since that might be easier. I'll look for two numbers that multiply to give me the constant term and add to give me the middle coefficient.\n\nHmm, I'm having trouble factoring this one.
