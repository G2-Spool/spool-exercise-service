    "feedback": "It seems like you're struggling with understanding how to solve quadratic equations. Let's break it down step-by-step. First, recognize that the equation -2x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 is already in standard form. The goal is to solve for x, which tells us where the player lands. The quadratic formula is x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a. Here, a = -2, b = 4, and c = 1. Start by calculating the discriminant, which is b\u00b2 - 4ac = 16 + 8 = 24. Then, substitute these values into the formula to find x. This will give you the points where the player lands. I recommend practicing these steps with different equations to build your confidence. If you're still unsure, try reaching out to a teacher or tutor for additional help. Remember, understanding the process is more important than just getting the answer.",
