However, you need to apply these methods step-by-step. Start by clearly identifying the equation: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0. Then, choose a method to solve it. If you choose factoring, look for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to -6, which are -2 and -4, allowing you to rewrite the equation as (x - 2)(x - 4) = 0. Solve each factor to find x = 2 and x = 4. These solutions represent the optimal positions for the acoustic panels. Keep practicing these steps, and don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.
