  "student_response": "\nLooking at this quadratic equation problem, I need to solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what type of problem this is - it's a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so I need to find the values of x that make this equation true.\n\nLet me work through this systematically:\n\n1. I'll identify the coefficients: a, b, and c from the equation\n2. I'll determine the best method to solve it - I can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula\n3. I'll check if it factors easily first, since that's often the most efficient method\n4. If factoring works, I'll factor the expression and set each factor equal to zero\n5. I'll solve for x in each case\n6. Finally, I'll substitute my answers back into the original equation to verify they're correct\n\nFor the quadratic formula method as backup: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nThis systematic approach ensures I don't miss any steps and can verify my solution. I'll also check that my final answers make sense in the context of the original problem.\n\nThe verification step is crucial - I'll substitute both solutions back into the original equation to confirm they work, and I'll consider whether the solutions make practical sense for the real-world context described in the problem.\n",
