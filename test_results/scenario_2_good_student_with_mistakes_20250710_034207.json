  "student_response": "\nI need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I can see this is a quadratic equation, so I need to find the x values. I think I should use the quadratic formula since that always works.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nLet me identify my coefficients from the equation... I think a is the coefficient of x\u00b2, b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant term.\n\nWait, actually let me try factoring first since that might be easier. I'll look for two numbers that multiply to give me the constant term and add to give me the middle coefficient.\n\nHmm, I'm having trouble factoring this one. Let me go back to the quadratic formula approach.\n\nSo plugging into the formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nI need to calculate the discriminant first - that's b\u00b2 - 4ac. If it's positive, I'll have two real solutions.\n\nAfter calculating... I get x = ... (I'm not showing my arithmetic here but I calculated it)\n\nLet me check my work by plugging one solution back in... Actually, I think I made an error somewhere in my calculations. The numbers don't look right when I substitute back.\n\nI should probably double-check my identification of the coefficients and redo the calculation more carefully.\n",
